## Counterfactual Explanations


*"You were denied a loan because your annual income was £30,000. If your income had been £45,000, you would have been offered a loan."*


[They](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00399.pdf) define Counterfactual Explanations as statements taking the form:

*"Score p was returned because variables V had values (v1,v2,...) associated with them. If V instead had values (v1',v2',...), and all other variables had remained constant, score p' would have been returned."*

## Adversarial Examples versus Counterfactual Examples


### Adversarial Example
* $$x_{adv}=x+\epsilon \times\text{sign(} \nabla f_{x}(x,y)\text{  )}$$
* Invisible to human eyes (see the Figure below.).

### Counterfactual Example

* $$x_{c}=x+v$$, where $$v$$ only modifies few variables to $$x$$. 


## Problem Formulation
Given function $$f: X \mapsto Y$$ and $$n$$ number of sample points, $$(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n)$$ sampled *i.i.d.* from distribution $$P(X,Y)$$, for each $$(x_i,y_i)$$, we want to find the counterfactual example $$(x^c_i,y^c_i)$$ such that,

1. $$d(x^c_i,x_i) \leq \epsilon $$, for some $$d(\cdot,\cdot)$$
2. $$f(x^c_i)=y^c_i$$, where $$y_i \neq y^c_i$$.

This can be done by solving the following optimization probblem:

$$ \arg\min_{x'_i}   \mathcal{L}(f(x'_i),y^c_i) +d(x_i,x'_i) $$


### Choice of Distance Measure

* Squared Euclidean Distance : 

\begin{align}  d(x_i,x^c_i) = \sum^d_{k=1} (x_{i,k} - x^c_{i,k})^2 \end{align}
* Scaled Squared Euclidean Distance :

\begin{align}  d(x_i,x^c_i) = \sum^d_{k=1} \frac{(x_{i,k} - x^c_{i,k})^2}{std_k(x)} \end{align}

* Scaled L1 Norm :

\begin{align}  d(x_i,x^c_i) = \sum^d_{k=1} \frac{|x_{i,k} - x^c_{i,k}|}{MAP_k} \quad \text{where,} 
 \end{align} 
\begin{align}  {MAP_k} = median_j (|x_{j,k}  -median_l(x_{l,k})|)
 \end{align} 

## Empirical Results

### LSAT Dataset
* prediction output : student's first-year average grade.
* features :  race, grade-point average prior to law school, and law
school entrance exam scores.


### Counterfactual Question
*“What would have to be changed to give a predicted score of 0?”*

* Person 1: If your LSAT was 34.0, you would have an
average predicted score (0).
* Person 2: If your LSAT was 32.4, you would have an
average predicted score (0).
* Person 3: If your LSAT was 33.5, and you were ‘white’,
you would have an average predicted score (0).
* Person 4: If your LSAT was 35.8, and you were ‘white’,
you would have an average predicted score (0).
* Person 5: If your LSAT was 34.9, you would have an
average predicted score (0).



## Feasibility of Counterfactual Examples [(Src.)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03277.pdf)

### Structural Causal Model [(Pearl)](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/)

A causal model is a triple $$M= <U,V,F>$$ such that $$U$$ is a set of exogenous variables, $$V$$ is a set of endogenous variables that are determined by variables inside the model, and $$F$$ is a set of functions that determine the value of each $$v_i \in V$$ (up to some independent noise) based on values of $$U_i \in U$$ and $$Pa_i \in V$$ \ $$v_i$$.

### Global Feasibility

Let $$<x_i,y_i>$$ be the input features and the predicted outcome from $$h$$, and let $$y'$$ be the desired output class. Let $$M=<U,V,F>$$ be a causal model over $$\mathcal{X}$$ such that each feature is in $$U 	\cup V$$. Then, a counterfactual $$<x_{cf},y_{cf}>$$ is global feasible if it is valid $$(y_{cf}=y')$$, the change from $$x_i$$ to $$x_{cf}$$ satisfies all constraints entailed by the causal model, and all exogenous variabbles $$x^{exog}=U$$ lie within the input domain.

### Generative Model

\begin{align} 
\bullet \Pr(x^{cf}|y',x) \quad \text{such that } x^{cf} \text{ belings to class } y' 
\end{align}

\begin{align} 
\bullet \text{ encoder} \quad q(z|x,y') 
\end{align}

\begin{align} 
\bullet \text{ decoder} \quad p(x^{cf}|z,y')
\end{align}


### Evidence lower bound (ELBO)

\begin{align} 
\ln{\Pr(x^{cf}|y',x)} \geq \mathbb{E}_{Q(z|x,y')} \ln{\Pr(x^{cf}|z,y',x)} - \mathbb{KL}(Q(z|x,y'||\Pr(z|y',x)))
\end{align}

### Approximation


 $$\min - \mathbb{E}_{Q(z|x,y')} \ln{\Pr(x^{cf}|z,y',x)} + \mathbb{KL}(Q(z|x,y'||\Pr(z|y',x))) \\
 \approx \min \mathbb{E}_{Q(z|x,y')} [\text{Dist(}x,x^{cf}\text{)} + \lambda \text{HingeLoss(}h(x^{cf},y',\beta)\text{)} ] + \mathbb{KL}(Q(z|x,y'||\Pr(z|y',x)))
$$

### Causal Distance

Given causal graph $$G$$ over $$U\cup V$$ and mechanisms $$F$$, for each $$v \in V$$, we have $$v=f(v_{p1},\dots,v_{pk}) + \epsilon$$, where $$\{v_{p1},\dots,v_{p_k}\}$$ are the parents of $$v$$. We can define the $$Distance$$ for the nodes $$v \in V$$ as follows:

\begin{align} 
    \text{DistCausal}_v (x_v,x_v^{cf}) = \text{Distance}_v (x_v,f(x_{v_{p1}}^{cf},\dots,x_{v_{pk}}^{cf}  ) )  
\end{align}


$$\text{DistCausal}_v (x_v,x_v^{cf}) = \text{Distance}_v (x_v,f(x_{v_{p1}}^{cf},\dots,x_{v_{pk}}^{cf}  ) )$$
