## Counterfactual Explanations


*"You were denied a loan because your annual income was £30,000. If your income had been £45,000, you would have been offered a loan."*


We define Counterfactual Explanations as statements taking the form:

*"Score p was returned because variables V had values (v1,v2,...) associated with them. If V instead had values (v1',v2',...), and all other variables had remained constant, score p' would have been returned."*
