## Truth Table For "If...., then...."

| P | Q | If P, then Q |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| T   | T   | T   |
| T   | F   | F   |
|----
| F   | T   | T   |
| F   | F   | T   |
|=====
{: rules="groups"}


## Pattern

We want to proof "If A then B"

1. Assume A and ~B (A is true and B is false)
2. Derive (A is true and B is false to a contradiction)

..    1. Possibly contradicting to original assumptions

..    2. or contradicting to facts, e.g. 2>1
3. We then proof If A then B by contradiction
